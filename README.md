Wear The Weather
> There's no bad weather, only bad clothing.

# How it started
It started with our family being overwhelmed by differences in climate between places where we've been and Seattle, and between each member.
What I feel like hot just enough to turn on the fan, my partner feels like burning. 
What I feel like freezing, my partner feels like it's the best time to put on shorts.
It became more complicate when we had kids, since they are not yet able to link the feeling of too cold with putting on extra layers, and so on.

# What it solves
This app enables children to be more independent when dressing themselves with weather-appropriate clothings.
It follows Montessori method in giving children autonomy within a safe guideline.

# How to use it
Put your location (city name or ZIP code) and it will give you information about the weather and recommendation of clothing items that are weather-appropriate.
